    "Business Problem: The goal of this assignment is to accurately predict whether a patients breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign. With this second opinion, doctors can better server our community by treating patients who have malignant tumors. The model should assist doctors in determining whether treatment is needed based on tumor classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Applications: Using a Naive Bayes to read chest X-Rays to determine if a patient has COVID, pneumonia, or normal scans. Second example is using K-Means clustering to read Alzheimer's patient data to search for commonalities between patients. Third example is using logistic regression to classify a patient's diabetes as type 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Algorithms: \n",
    "Naive Bayes:\n",
    "Using Bayes' Theorem, we can determine which class an object belongs to and use its features to predict future objects. Naive Bayes also assumes that all attributes of a data record are independent. This algorithm is great for its speed and ability to slice through high dimensions of data like text and email. Unfortunately, assuming all attributes are independent is not something that happens often in real life scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Logistic regression differs from linear regression in a few ways. Linear regression can be used to predict any values along a straight line, however, logistic regression tries to predict values between 0 and 1. As such, we use Logistic regression for classification problems where we are trying to determine 0 and 1. Using thresholds, we can determine the class an object can fall into. Just like Naive Bayes, Linear regression is simple and can provide results with great speed and limited processing powers. Unfortunately, Linear regression requires a large focus on data quality and ensuring no missing values exist in the dataset. The algorithm does not handle missing data very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "The goal of a decision tree algorithm is to predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. The tree portion is the different questions or qualifications that lead you to a corresponding leaf. The leaf is the classification outcome expected from the model. Decision trees are very simple and easy to understand, however they are not very stable as any change to the data can cause negative impacts to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means:\n",
    "A K-Means model uses the sum of squares to group data into centroids. The model will work to group simliar datapoints together and point out patterns. Simple, flexible and great for a large dataset. However, it is memory intensive and requires a lot of computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing Discussion: I took a look at the dataset to see how many rows and columns we had. Knowing that, I took it a step further to see if any of the data points were blank. Lastly, I ensured the datapoints made sense by checking for extreme outliers. An example of that would be looking for a value of over 1000 because a tumor shouldn't be that large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining Metrics: In the metrics section, I was mostly focused on ensuring we looked at each of the features. Understanding their importance is key in understanding how the model is functioning with the data. I used importance scores to rank each of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting Results: I used accuracy calculation, ROC/AUG values, and the confusion matrix to evaluate the models performance. Taking into account that we are in the healthcare industry and lives are at stake, maximizing performance while ensuring the least amount of false negatives were created was paramount. False positives leave patients with life threatening tumors believing they are safe and sound when they are in need of treatment. Based on the ROC/AUG and false positive values, I determined Naive Bayes model performed the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Steps: The first step in optimizing performance, in my opinion, would be to use the feature importance values calculated in the explain metrics section to limit the amount of features fed to the model. Next, I would tune the models to ensure we had virtually 0 false negatives to ensure patient safety."
